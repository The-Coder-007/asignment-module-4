/*

OOP, or Object-Oriented Programming, is a programming paradigm based on the concept of "objects," which can contain data in the form of fields (also known as attributes or properties) and code in the form of procedures (also known as methods or functions). OOP allows developers to model real-world entities and their interactions more accurately and efficiently.

These concepts are fundamental to understanding and implementing object-oriented programming principles effectively

Class: Blueprint for creating objects, defines attributes and methods.

Object: Instance of a class with specific attributes and behaviors.

Encapsulation: Bundling data and methods within a class to hide internal workings.

Inheritance: Mechanism for a class to inherit properties and behaviors from another class.

Polymorphism: Ability of objects to take on multiple forms or perform different actions.

Abstraction: Simplifying complex systems by focusing on essential aspects.
