/*

OOP (Object-Oriented Programming) focuses on modeling real-world entities as objects with data and behaviors, emphasizing encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism.
POP (Procedural-Oriented Programming) organizes code around procedures or functions, focusing on breaking down tasks into smaller, reusable procedures and explicit data handling through function calls.
In short, OOP revolves around objects and their interactions, while POP centers around procedures or functions and their sequence of steps to accomplish tasks.
